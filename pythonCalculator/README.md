## Description:
I decided on Python as my language of choice for the project. Below is a list of just a few reasons for my decision:
  1. Python is versatile along with clear syntax
  2. The community seemed to be massive and supportive (as others are I'm sure)
  3. With that massive community brings forth **many** pre-built libraries & frameworks
  

Upon further research into Python, I came to find a few GUI (Graphical User Interface)
  frameworks/libraries that could be imported once downloaded.
  - *PySimpleGUI*
  - *Kivy*
  - *PyQt5*
